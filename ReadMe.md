## Description

This app allows you to take notes or use as a planner. You can type up notes, save them to a side bar, and delete them when you are done with them.

## Usage Instruction

Download node.js, open your terminal, navigate to this app folder and run the code 
`npm install` 

Then you will get a local server to run the app in. Once you are on the site, you will be presented a button to enter your notes. When you click the button, you can then create a note with a title. When you are done creating a note, you can save it with a button on the top right of the page. When you click the save button, it will create a new saved note on the left hand side of the page where you can click and modify them again.

## Learning Point

This project was confusing on how to navigate all these different folders and each file having their own function. Having premade code to start with did help with this heavy task but still require a way to connect each file to the right file. I got lost a few times with how you were connecting the server.js to the index.js and the path needed to be taken.
